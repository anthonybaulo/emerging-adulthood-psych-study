## Data
The data comes from [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/te54b/), a free and open platform to support research and enable collaboration.

The EAMMI2 is a large scale collaborative project with 32 primary contributors across 32 different locations, with the initial data collection ending in December 2016. 90% of the entries come from the US, with 10% coming from England, Greece, and Grenada.

To summarize, this was a survey given primarily to young adults ages 18-25 regarding their attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs related to Emerging Adulthood. It took about 30 minutes, on average, to complete, and contained around 200 questions, spanning categories such as:
* Markers of Adulthood
* Idea
* Subjective Well-being
* Mindful
* Belonging
* Efficacy
* Support
* Transgressions
* Stress
* Marriage
* Narcissism

Most of the answers were ordinal (e.g. on a scale of 1-7, how likely you agree with a statement)<br>
